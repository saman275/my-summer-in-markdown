# My Summer in Markdown

## Intro:
Hi, my name is Sam An. I am a senior attending Chatsworth Charter High School. I play for the Chatsworth Volleyball team, have 1 younger brother, and I love cars. I also love boxing, jiu-jitsu, thrifting, and listening to music.

## New Skills Learned: 
Over the summer, I learned how to drive a manual car. This took me an extremely long time to understand and learn. Learning how to drive a manual was extremely challenging because of how challenging because it requires the coordination of multiple tasks simultaneously. Drivers must master the use of the clutch, gear shifter, and accelerator while managing the vehicle's speed and power. This involves developing a sense of timing to shift gears smoothly and avoiding stalling, which can be difficult for beginners.

## Sports:
I traveled to Florida for the AAU Boys National Volleyball Tournament. It was a 4-dau tournament with teams from all over the United States. We played teams from Milwaukee, Puerto Rico, Florida, and New York. The stakes were high as this was our team's last tournament. We were very successful, with a record 10-2 and placing 3rd out of 66 teams bringing home a bronze medal and trophy.

## Expectations for the Class:
I want to take a computer science course because it’s a great way to build crucial skills in programming and problem-solving. It’s like learning a new language that can open doors to a ton of exciting career options in tech, whether it’s software development, data analysis, or cybersecurity. Plus, it helps me understand how technology works and how I can contribute to its advancement. Overall, it’s a solid investment in my future, both personally and professionally.

## Summer Trip to Florida
My family and I went to Florida over the summer. We went to Gatorland and saw extremely big alligators.
